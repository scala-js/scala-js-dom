/** The AudioParam interface represents an audio-related parameter, usually a parameter of an AudioNode (such as
  * GainNode.gain). An AudioParam can be set to a specific value or a change in value, and can be scheduled to happen at
  * a specific time and following a specific pattern.
  *
  * There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:
  *
  *   - An a-rate AudioParam takes the current audio parameter value for each sample frame of the audio signal.
  *   - A k-rate AudioParam uses the same initial audio parameter value for the whole block processed, that is 128
  *     sample frames.
  *
  * Each AudioNode defines which of its parameters are a-rate or k-rate in the spec.
  *
  * Each AudioParam has a list of events, initially empty, that define when and how values change. When this list is not
  * empty, changes using the AudioParam.value attributes are ignored. This list of events allows us to schedule changes
  * that have to happen at very precise times, using arbitrary timelime-based automation curves. The time used is the
  * one defined in AudioContext.currentTime.
