/** The window object represents the window itself. The document property of a window points to the DOM document loaded
  * in that window. A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.
  *
  * In a tabbed browser, such as Firefox, each tab contains its own window object (and if you're writing an extension,
  * the browser window itself is a separate window too - see Working with windows in chrome code for more information).
  * That is, the window object is not shared between tabs in the same window. Some methods, namely window.resizeTo and
  * window.resizeBy apply to the whole window and not to the specific tab the window object belongs to. Generally,
  * anything that can't reasonably pertain to a tab pertains to the window instead.
