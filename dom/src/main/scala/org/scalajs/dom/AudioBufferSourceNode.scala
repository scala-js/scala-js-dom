/** AudioBufferSourceNode has no input and exactly one output. The number of channels in the output corresponds to the
  * number of channels of the AudioBuffer that is set to the AudioBufferSourceNode.buffer property. If there is no
  * buffer set—that is, if the attribute's value is NULL—the output contains one channel consisting of silence. An
  * AudioBufferSourceNode can only be played once; that is, only one call to AudioBufferSourceNode.start() is allowed.
  * If the sound needs to be played again, another AudioBufferSourceNode has to be created. Those nodes are cheap to
  * create, and AudioBuffers can be reused across plays. It is often said that AudioBufferSourceNodes have to be used in
  * a "fire and forget" fashion: once it has been started, all references to the node can be dropped, and it will be
  * garbage-collected automatically.
  *
  * Multiple calls to AudioBufferSourceNode.stop() are allowed. The most recent call replaces the previous one, granted
  * the AudioBufferSourceNode has not already reached the end of the buffer.
  *
  *   - Number of inputs: 0
  *   - Number of outputs: 1
  *   - Channel count: defined by the associated AudioBuffer
