/** The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module like an audio source
  * (e.g. an HTML &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; element, an OscillatorNode, etc.), the audio destination, intermediate
  * processing module (e.g. a filter like BiquadFilterNode or ConvolverNode), or volume control (like GainNode).
  *
  * An AudioNode has inputs and outputs, each with a given amount of channels. An AudioNode with zero inputs and one or
  * multiple outputs is called a source node. The exact processing done varies from one AudioNode to another but, in
  * general, a node reads its inputs, does some audio-related processing, and generates new values for its outputs, or
  * simply lets the audio pass through (for example in the AnalyserNode, where the result of the processing is accessed
  * separately).
  *
  * Different nodes can be linked together to build a processing graph. Such a graph is contained in an AudioContext.
  * Each AudioNode participates in exactly one such context. In general, processing nodes inherit the properties and
  * methods of AudioNode, but also define their own functionality on top. See the individual node pages for more
  * details, as listed on the Web Audio API homepage.
