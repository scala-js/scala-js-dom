/** The OscillatorNode interface represents a periodic waveform, like a sine wave. It is an AudioNode audio-processing
  * module that causes a given frequency of sine wave to be created â€” in effect, a constant tone.
  *
  * An OscillatorNode is created using the AudioContext.createOscillator method. It always has exactly one output and no
  * inputs, both with the same amount of channels. Its basic property defaults (see AudioNode for definitions) are:
  *
  *   - Number of inputs: 0
  *   - Number of outputs: 1
  *   - Channel count mode: max
  *   - Channel count: 2 (not used in the default count mode)
  *   - Channel interpretation: speakers
