/**
 * The SharedWorker interface represents a specific kind of worker that can be
 * accessed from several browsing contexts, such as several windows, iframes or
 * even workers. They implement an interface different than dedicated workers
 * and have a different global scope, SharedWorkerGlobalScope.
 *
 * MDN
 * @constructor The SharedWorker constructor creates a SharedWorker object that
 *              executes the script at the specified URL.This script must obey
 *              the same-origin policy.
 *
 *              If the URL has an invalid syntax or if the same-origin
 *              policy is violated, a DOMException of type SECURITY_ERR is thrown.
 * @example
 * {{{var myWorker = new SharedWorker("aURL", name);}}}
 * @param stringUrl A DOMString representing the URL of the script the worker
 *                  will execute. It must obey the same-origin policy.
 * @param name An optional argument that specifies an existing
 *             SharedWorkerGlobalScope.name â€” if this is specified then that
 *             SharedWorkerGlobalScope will be used as the scope for this
 *             shared worker.
